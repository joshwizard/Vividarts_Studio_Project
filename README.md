<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Viviarts Studio Project

Azubi_GPT_Chatbot is a simple python chatbot powered by Tkinter GUI with AWS DynamoDB database backing. 

### Collaborations
This is a hands-on cloud engineering project delivered by the azubi africa cloud team in 2023. After 6 months of AWS cloud training, we got a chance to work on some realife cloud projects. 
I was able to work with:
 1. Kwadwo Fosu Appiah
 2. Jean-Pierre Gbedjissi
 3. Augustine Gideon
 4. Gladys Aba Kwofie
 5. Madalisto Gongoni
 6. Prince Kafui Ocloo

### Project Overview
```sh
Technologies
1. Python
2. HTML, CSS and JavaScript
3. Docker
4. AWS S3
5. Terraform
6. Jenkins

```

##
```sh
   1. Create photo editing tools
```
Choose a Python library (OpenCV) for image processing and define specific editing features.
* Write a Python program for photo editing with the selected library.
  
##
```sh
   2. Create a User Friendly Interface
```
For users to interact with this web app, appealing GUI interface cannot be ignored.
* Decide on a GUI framework for Python (Flask/Django).
* Design the interface with the necessary photo editing features.
* Intergrate the program with the choosen GUI framework.
##
```sh
   3. Containerize your python application
```
For a reliable application and in need of lightweight technology, Docker comes in without question.
* Set up Docker for containerization.
* Create a Dockerfile for your Python app.
* Build and test the Docker Image locally.

##
```sh
   4. Create cloud storage for your photos using AWS S3
```
AWS S3 is secure and offer more reliable storage.
* Create an AWS Account
* Set up an S3 bucket for storing edited photos.
* Secure access to the bucket with proper permissions.
* Use Python AWS SDK (Such as Boto3) to interact with S3.
* Implement uploading and downloading of photos.

##
```sh
   5. Create Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
```
* We chose Terraform to run scripts
* Define infrastructure components such as S3 buckets.
* Test the scripts to ensure they create tge desired resources.

##
```sh
   6. Create CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins
```
Suitable pipeline that triggers code changes.
* Define stages, by also building the Docker image testing anf deployment.
